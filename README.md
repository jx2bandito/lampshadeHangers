# Lampshade Hangers Co.<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lampshde Hangers Co. is a fake website for a fake company. For this project, I wanted to experiment with combining 
ScrollMagic and GSAP. Creating a responsive design, specifically keeping the page intact when resizing, was unexpectedly challenging 
since some features of ScrollMagic didn't readily support responsive units. This project also includes a bit of SVG - I had to combine
multiple SVG elements to create the load animation. Check it out at https://jx2bandito.github.io/lampshadeHangers/.

### User Stories: <br />
* User can pick a section from the navigation bar and the page will animate accordingly, using ScrollMagic with GSAP.
* User can view an animation when the page first loads
* User can update the shopping section
* User is presented with a contact section that also includes links to social media
