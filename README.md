# Lampshade Hangers Co.<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lampshade Hangers Co. is a fake website for a fake company. For this project, I wanted to experiment with combining 
ScrollMagic and GSAP. Creating a responsive design, specifically keeping the page intact when resizing, was unexpectedly challenging 
since some features of ScrollMagic didn't readily support responsive units. Eventually, I decided that as impressive as it might look, unpredictable scrolling effects can be bad for user experience, so I locked manual scrolling and delegated the scrolling to the navigation menu. The user doesn't have to deal with making sure they scroll to the correct place, but behind the scenes the website is scrolling. This project also includes a bit of SVG - I had to combine multiple SVG elements to create the load animation.
